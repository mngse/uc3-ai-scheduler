# uc3-ai-scheduler

A small scheduler project for the UC3 AI experiments. This repository contains configuration examples and utilities to run scheduling tasks for experiments.

## Quick start

- Clone the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/mngse/uc3-ai-scheduler.git

- Inspect the example configuration files in the repo root (for example `uc3-v11.yaml` and `uc3-v12.yaml`).

## Usage

- The repository contains YAML configuration files used by the scheduler. Typical steps:
	1. Edit or create a configuration file (see `Configuration` below).
 2. Run the scheduler or orchestration script (not provided in this README). Replace this line with the actual command when available.

## Configuration

- Example files in this repo:
	- `uc3-v11.yaml` — example configuration version 11
	- `uc3-v12.yaml` — example configuration version 12

- Keep configuration files in YAML format. Document important keys and defaults inside the YAML files or in a separate docs directory.
